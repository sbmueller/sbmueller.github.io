## About me

I'm a software engineer for autonomous driving at [ZF Group](https://www.zf.com).

My background is in electrical engineering and information technology, where I
gained excellent theoretical knowledge of communications engineering and signal
processing. During extracurricular activities, I successfully took part in
several competitions dealing with transmission, reception and parameter
estimation of diverse waveforms using [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/).
Additionally, the Google Summer of Code program 2016 has provided me with
plenty of hands-on experience in `C++` and `Python` while developing a signal
analysis toolbox for GNU Radio.

Since the end of 2017, I have been working at ZF Group; first
as a signal processing engineer, focusing on software implementations of
state-of-the-art RADAR algorithms in `Python`, and recently as a `C++` software
engineer for autonomous driving perception.

I easily get enthused by tasks about signal processing, software engineering
and working with cutting-edge technology.

Opinions are my own etc.
