## About me

I'm a software engineer for fundamental C++ libraries.

I'm an Electrical Engineer (M.Sc.) who specialized in software engineering and
digital signal processing. Since 2017, I have been working as a signal
processing engineer, focusing on software implementations of state-of-the-art
RADAR algorithms in Python, and since 2020 as a C++ software engineer for
autonomous driving perception as part of an agile team (since March 2020 fully
remote). I easily get enthused by tasks about signal processing, software
engineering and working with cutting-edge technology. I am constantly looking
for new challenges, currently in particular with strong Rust focus.

I strongly believe in life long learning and try to improve myself by 1%
everyday. I love working out, both endurance (did an Ironman 70.3 in 2022) and
strength and love reading nonfiction books (recently about stoicism).

Opinions are my own etc.
