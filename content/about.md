## About me

I'm an engineer (M.Sc.) with over five years of experience as an individual
contributor and almost one year of experience in engineering leadership. I have
worked as a signal processing engineer, focusing on software implementations of
state-of-the-art RADAR algorithms in Python, as a C++ software engineer for
autonomous driving perception, and as product owner/tech lead for fundamental
C++ libraries. I am constantly looking for new challenges, currently in
particular with a strong Rust focus.

Opinions are my own etc.
