## About me

I'm a software engineer with over seven years of experience as an individual
contributor and two years of experience in engineering leadership. I have worked
as a signal processing engineer, focusing on software implementations of
state-of-the-art RADAR algorithms in Python, as a C++ software engineer for
autonomous driving perception, as a senior software engineer for
fundamental C++ libraries, and lastly as software architect for embedded GNSS
software. I'm passionate about clean code, high-integrity software and
cutting-edge technology.

Opinions are my own etc.
