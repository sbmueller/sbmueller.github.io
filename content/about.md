## About me

I'm a software engineer with over six years of experience as an individual
contributor and one year of experience in engineering leadership. I have worked
as a signal processing engineer, focusing on software implementations of
state-of-the-art RADAR algorithms in Python, as a C++ software engineer for
autonomous driving perception, and as a senior software engineer for
fundamental C++ libraries. I'm passionate about clean code, high-integrity
software and cutting-edge technology.

Opinions are my own etc.
